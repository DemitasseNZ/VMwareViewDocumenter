This is a proof of concept more than a useful script.

Run the PowerShell script on a View Conneciton Server to gather data into CSV files.

Run the same PowerShell script on a machine with Word installed & it creates a report from the csv files in the same directory.

If your Connection Server has Word installed then both phases are run in one script execution.

***To Do***

- Make table generation more generic, create table from array of data
- Some error handling
